Ciao Christian, 
ecco l'esercizio da svolgere offline e consegnare entro domenica sera.

Grazie mille e buon lavoro.
Pietro

You are to build a web application that provides a simple telephone directory.
Technicalities

    You may use whatever programming language/platform you prefer. Use something that you know well.
    You must release your work with an OSI-approved open source license of your choice.
    You must deliver the sources of your application, with a README that explains how to compile and run it.

Entries
The application handles a set of entries, that contain a first name, last name, and a telephone number.
The entries should be validated, so that it's not possible to enter an empty first or last name; and the phone number should be of the form

+39 02 1234567

That is a "+" followed by a nonempty group of digits, a space, a nonempty group of digits, a space, a group of digits with at least 6 digits.

The application consists of the following pages:

    Home page
        Contains a text field that allows to search through all the entries by name or number. When I enter text in the field, the page will be reloaded with a table containing all the entries that match the text I entered.
        The page contains a link to the "add new entry" page.
        When an entry is displayed, it contains a link to the "edit this entry" page.
    Add new entry page
        Contains a form for entering a new entry.
    Edit entry page
        Contains a form for modifying an existing entry.

Extra activities (not mandatory)

    Commit your code on github or any other SCM repository you prefer (e.g. bitbucket, gitlab, etc)
    Deploy your webapp on heroku.
